## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#4CAF50), to evoke growth, nature, and connection to the land, for a calming effect that aligns with rural settings.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a desaturated version of the primary, for a soft and warm feel.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFC107), analogous to green, adds vibrancy and highlights important elements.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for headlines, lending an intellectual, vintage feel, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, for modern readability.
- Use simple, clear icons representing subjects and features; ensure icons are easily understandable in low-connectivity environments.
- Design a clean, intuitive layout, optimizing for low bandwidth and accessibility on various devices; prioritize essential information and reduce unnecessary elements.
- Use minimal animations, such as subtle transitions, to enhance user experience without consuming excessive bandwidth.
